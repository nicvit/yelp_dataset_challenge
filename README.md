# Foundations of Data Science - Yelp Challenge

**Group 4:** *Hujiang Lin, Adisorn Jaroensathayatham, Antonios Andronis, Nicola Vitale, Nikolaos Perrakis*

**Main idea:** Yelp Dataset Challenge - 6th round - [Yelp Dataset Challenge](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge)

**Key point:** Join Yelp's knowledge discovery challenge.

**Idea description:** We are going to participate in Yelp's Dataset Challenge. The one we are most interested in is the one regarding an NLP classifier to classify user reviews and extract information from them, although we can consider any one of them. We are interested in using IBM Watson NLP classifier (it has an API, but limited free quotas and we‘ve never used it before), or open-source NLPs (like the ones Prof. Simperl suggested us). We plan to demonstrate the whole Data Science pipeline in our analysis of Yelp’s datasets. Given the dataset’s structure we may not need to do much data cleaning so we will focus on knowledge discovery and data visualization. We intend to
conduct research on Yelp’s datasets that will be creative and innovative enough to be able to publish it in a relevant research journal. 

**Yelp Challenges Information:** A lot of universities have taken part on previews challenges and it would be good if we managed to get a prize. The winning submissions are published and their team is invited to give a public presentation of their work.
